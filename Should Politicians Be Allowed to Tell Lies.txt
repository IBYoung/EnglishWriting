Most of us don't realize that all of the politicians are liars, not just the other side.
A lot of politicians are really good guys that got tempted or pushed into situations where they acted against their own moral virtues. 
Not saying it's justifiable, but you have to consider that if you were in their position, 
could you stay 100% pure and true? 
We already lie and do other unethical things on almost a daily basis in our own lives, 
but their lives are more extreme and publicized which is the only reason they're the ones to face the ridicule. 
At the same time, though, we don't really allow it. 
When we find out about scandals, these politicians are basically forced to resign. 
So I'm not sure how we allow them to lie to us.
